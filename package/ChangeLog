        - Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi state, WPS-PBC, Ethernet bridge, SoftAP, FOTA
        - Protocol: TCP/UDP
        - Power save
        - Peripheral: GPIO, UART, ADC, NVS, PWM, sensors, etc.
        - Middleware: XML, JSON, AWS, MQTT, HTTP
        - Scenario: PS schedule, UART data handling

    Known Issues

        * The initial connection time for WPA3-SAE/OWE can be quite lengthy (> 15 seconds) due to the substantial computational load required by software for large number operations.
        * The SoftAP disable/enable sequence on the standalone mode is not supported.
        * The issue of deauthentication frame delivery failure can occur between PMF-enabled NRC7394 and PMF-enabled NRC7292 devices.
        * During deep sleep, TCP connections are not maintained. Upon waking up, a new TCP connection must be established.
        * The AT-CMD throughput over HSPI interface is slightly lower than NRC7292 device.
