1. Prepare firmware to be used for Firmware Over The Air (FOTA).
Build any sample application that will be used for firmware upgrade.

2. Once the firmware is built, use crc.py provided in sdk/apps/sample_fota/python-http-server/python/crc.py
i.e.
./crc.py <firmware file name>.bin

3. An example "version" file that is used in sample_fota is provided in sdk/apps/sample_fota/example_server_contents.

4. Python web server script is provided in sdk/apps/sample_fota/python-http-server.
To start the web server, copy python-http-server directory to a Linux computer with python3 installed.
Once copied,
cd python-http-server
./Run-server.sh {http|https}

If http is used, server will run on port 8080.
If https is used, server will run on port 4443.

5. SSL supporting example server certificate and server private key is provided in python-http-server/ssl-cert, and Run-server.sh script and corresponding python script will use the certificate exists for HTTPS communication.

6. Copy the firmware to be upgrade to the directory where the "Run-server.sh" is starting.
   Create "version" (Example version file is provided in sdk/apps/sample_fota/example_server_contents) and place it in the same directory where "Run-server.sh" was executed.

7. Once the preparation is completed, then install sample_fota firmware on target device and restart.

Note :
1. You don't need to use python web server. If you prefer, you can use readily available web server on a server.
2. sample_fota uses certificates and key in directory sdk/apps/sample_fota/certs. The certificates and key are converted as a C header file fota_certs.h.
