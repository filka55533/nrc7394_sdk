Tool Usage (Firmware Flash Tool)
====================================

Overview
--------
*Firmware Flash Tool* is a utility for running flash-related operations (reading/writing MAC addresses and uploading XIP standalone bootloader/ XIP standalone firmware) on NRC7292/NRC739X modules.

Tool Version
------------
* v6.2 (Default: FirmwareFlashTool.exe)
* v7.0 (Multi Upload: MultiFirmwareFlashTool.exe)

Binary Files
------------

.. warning::
   Make sure that the correct 2nd bootloader, XIP bootloader and XIP firmware binaries corresponding to the module types (NRC7292 or NRC7394) are selected!

**2nd Bootloader (written on RAM)**:
    is the 2nd bootloader binary file to be temporarily written on RAM to replace the mask ROM bootloader to augment the bootloader functionalities.

**XIP Bootloader (written on flash)**:
    is the XIP bootloader binary file to be stored on the flash memory. If the non-default 5s-wait XIP bootloader is uploaded on the module, the bootloader will wait for 5 seconds to handle firmware upload requests from the tool before jumping to the XIP firmware following a reset. This can be useful during the initial development phase for achieving a quick upload-test-debug cycle.

**XIP Firmware (written on flash)**:
    is the XIP firmware binary file to be stored on the flash memory.

**Auto-reset**:
    is an optional feature that triggers the bootloader to execute the uploaded XIP firmware following the upload procedure. This option is only valid with the non-default 5s-wait XIP bootloader operating in the standalone operation mode.

**Clear NVS Sector**:
    clears the NVS sector on the flash memory if selected.

Operation
---------
1. Set the DIP switch (for NRC7292) or jumper configuration (for NRC739X) to **Firmware Download / RAM Operation** mode as described on the instructions panel.
2. Select the desired procedures by using the corresponding check boxes: MAC adresss write, XIP bootloader write, and XIP firmware write.
3. Reset the board, and press the **START** button to run the selected procedures.

Multi Firmware Flash Tool
-------------------------
*Multi Firmware Flash Tool* is a variant of the *Firmware Flash Tool* that allows concurrent uploads.
